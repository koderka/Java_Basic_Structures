Algorithms

Euclidean algorithm: counts the greatest common divisor (GDC) for two positive integers. Example: GDC for integers 496 and 186 is 62.


Methods

Main1: converts a dog’s age into human years. First 2 dog years are equivalent to 10 human years, each subsequent – to 4 human years.

Main2: searches for the minimum value in each row of the 2-dimensional array and returns an array with those values.

Main3: counts number of smaller and greater elements than the average value in the 2-dimensional array, subsequently a method returns an 2-element array with those numbers.

Main4: copies an array to a temporary one of a double size, replenishes missing elements in the temporary array with the elements of first array in reverse order.

Main 5: counts a sum of all odd elements of the 2-dimensional array.
