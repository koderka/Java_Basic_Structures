Algorithms

Euclidean algorithm: counts the greatest common divisor (GDC) for two positive integers. Example: GDC for integers 496 and 186 is 62.

Arrays

Main1: creates an array with 20 randomly generated integers from 0 to 100 and returns a minimal value of the array.

Main2: creates an array with 10 integers and fills it with number 2.

Main3: creates an array with 10 integers, reverses its order and returns an array with reversed order.

Main4: sorts a given array of integers.

Main5: prints length of arrays in the 2-dimensional array as well as all its elements (each array in a separate row).

Main6: prints a sum of all elements in the array.

Main7: prints a trace of a matrix (sum of elements placed diagonally).

Methods

Main1: converts a dog’s age into human years. First 2 dog years are equivalent to 10 human years, each subsequent – to 4 human years.

Main2: searches for the minimum value in each row of the 2-dimensional array and returns an array with those values.

Main3: counts number of smaller and greater elements than the average value in the 2-dimensional array, subsequently a method returns an 2-element array with those numbers.

Main4: copies an array to a temporary one of a double size, replenishes missing elements in the temporary array with the elements of first array in reverse order.

Main5: counts a sum of all odd elements of the 2-dimensional array.


Reading Files

Main1: reads a file, counts and returns a number of marks in the file.

Main2: reads a file, counts and returns a number of words in the file.

Main3: reads a file with a list of people (with a given age) and returns an array of people who can retire (women older than 60 years, men older than 65 years). 

Main4: receives a number of a randomly generated integers, generates those values, sorts and returns them in form of an array.

Main5: reads a filename, checks if such file exists and creates a new file with suffix 2 which contains a double content of the first file.

Main6: reads numbers from the standard input, counts their sum and quantity (until a next input is a number “0”).

Main7: reads next lines from the standard input and saves them in the file (until a next input is a word “quit”).

Main8: creates a file with numbers and text, then reads a file and sums all numbers

Main9: reads a file, sorts all text lines and returns a sorted text.

Main10: creates a new directory if it does not exist.

Main11: creates a new file if it does not exist.

Main12: copies a content of a file to another file.
